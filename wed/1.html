  <p><p>An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance (also actress; see below).
    [1] The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio,
     and television. The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally
     "one who answers".[2] The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to
      the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. This can also be considered
      an "actor's role," which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. Interpretation occurs
      even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental performance art.</p>
